#WARNING: 
#   - Everything is case sensitive.
#   - Make sure to unbind any keys ingame that overlap unless you want the simultaneous commands.
#
#GUIDE:
#   - See: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/inputdev/virtual-key-codes
#   - Take the Value column's contents and place it in quotation marks and square brackets. 
#   - You can place multiple quotation mark surrounded keys separated by commas to represent key combinations.
#       *(e.g. ["0x31","0x32"] -> Press 1 and 2 at the same time.) Technically the 0x is optional.
#
#NOTES:
#   - Special exceptions will be added where there's no equivalent in the table.
#       *Currently these are: NOT WORKING
#           - "Scroll Up"
#           - "Scroll Down"

#===============================================================================================================#
#NOTES: You should probably unbind vanilla's next slot control.
#VERY IMPORTANT NOTE: I haven't figured out how to stop partially overlapping controls like shift+1 and 1 on to_0 and to_10 from breaking.
#(you can uncomment them and replace them with unique binds just fine though)
