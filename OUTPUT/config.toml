#GUIDE:
#   - See: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/inputdev/virtual-key-codes
#   - Take the Value column's contents and place it in square brackets. 
#   - You can place multiple inputs separated by commas into the square brackets to represent input combinations.
#       *(e.g. [0x31,0x32] -> Press 1 and 2 at the same time.)
#       *Activating an input combination means pressing one of its inputs while the rest are held down.
#       *Special inputs such as mouse inputs are probably mutually exclusive.
#           **(e.g. [0x100,0x01] -> scroll up and left click, this probably won't detect properly. It might. But probably not.)
#       *Additionally, special inputs usually have to be the last pressed key in practice.
#   - Make sure to unbind any keys ingame that overlap unless you want the simultaneous commands.
#       *With the exception of controls that begin with "notify". Those MUST overlap to work properly - set them to match your ingame settings.
#
#NOTES:
#   - Special exceptions will be added where there's no equivalent in the table. i.e. inputs that are not keys.
#       *Currently these are:
#           - 0x100: Scroll Up
#           - 0x101: Scroll Down
#           - 0x102: Scroll Left
#           - 0x103: Scroll Right
#           - 0x1???: The key 0x??? is a blacklist. If it's held down, the control won't activate.
#               *(e.g. 0x1031 is when you are not holding 1 down)
#               *This works as a nice solution to overlapping controls.
